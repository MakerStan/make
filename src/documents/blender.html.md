I installed Blender 2.70 from [here] (http://www.blender.org/download/). I extracted it and started it from the command prompt using this script from the extracted folder <code>./blender&</code>

**Shortcuts**
1. Using <code>Ctrl-Left Arrow</code> and <Crtl-Right Arrow> cycles through the available screens. This way you can quickly change screens from Default to Animation to Scripting etc.
2. Use <code>Shift-Space</code> to hide controls and optinos to give you a bigger modelling aread. Press it again to bring the controls back.
3. The 'tool shelf' panel on the left can be hidden using the 'T' key.

**References**
1. Blender Foundations by Roland Hess is a good book.
