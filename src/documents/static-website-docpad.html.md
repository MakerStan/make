Create a static website or blog using [Docpad](http://docpad.org). The code snippets below show how to setup, view and edit the files. Since DocPad is based on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), we start by installing that.

Install docpad and plugins for eco, livereload, markdown, coffeescript
<gist>9865462?file=install-docpad-and-plugins.sh</gist>
The [Beginner Guide](http://docpad.org/docs/begin) has a good explanation of why we need the plugins. Here is a short description of what they do:
1. [Eco](https://github.com/sstephenson/eco) lets us have templates so we can reuse code
2. [livereload](https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-livereload) enables automatic browser refreshes when files are changed
3. [marked](https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-marked) lets us use [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#Example) instead of HTML tags
4. [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) is a simple language that compiles into fast or faster than the equivalent handwritten JavaScript.
5. [Gist](https://gist.github.com) lets you host snippets of code on GitHub and embed them in your website or blog.

To deploy a static site generated by DocPad to Amazon S3, see [this post](edit-amazon-s3-files-linux.html).
